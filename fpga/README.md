# FIMD-FPGA: VHDL implementation of the Fast Isolated Marker Detection.

This repository contains the VHDL implementation of the Fast Isolated Marker Detection (FIMD) for low-end FPGA devices. It contains a Active-HDL project with a testbench to run a simulation of the FIMD on a sample dataset frame. Tested using Active-HDL 15 SE.
